# draughtsInJava

This is a program to run the famous game Draughts written in Java. It is also an assignment for one of my university courses, namely Programming 2. It does not have a GUI but can be run from the console. Also, it uses a one dimentional table to store piece position as opposed to a two dimensional one. Position numbering should be checked on the official Draughts page.
